    <h1>CT4 Seminar: Week 4 chat</h1>
    <p>10:03:20 From Ben Hooker to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi folks. We&rsquo;ll start in a minute or two.<br />10:05:50 From Eric Schubert to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Zoey&gt;&gt;Noah<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Noah&gt;&gt;Hongming<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hongming&gt;&gt;Guowei<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Guowei&gt;&gt;Yining<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Yining&gt;&gt;Fanxuan<br />10:06:13 From Eric Schubert to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Fanxuan &gt;&gt;Zhiyan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Zhiyan&gt;&gt;Mario<br />10:06:25 From Eric Schubert to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mario&gt;&gt;Alan<br />10:06:36 From Eric Schubert to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Alan&gt;&gt;Miao<br />10:06:47 From Eric Schubert to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Miao&gt;&gt;Blake<br />10:10:55 From Yue to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; yue&gt;&gt;Blake<br />10:11:37 From Chen Shiyi to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Shiyi &gt;&gt; yining<br />10:11:49 From Qianyue Yuwen to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Qianyue&gt;&gt;Zoey<br />10:12:45 From Eric Schubert to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Blake &gt;&gt; Yue<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Yue&gt;&gt;Qianyue<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Qianyue&gt;&gt;Shiyi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Shiyi&gt;&gt;Yiran<br />10:12:53 From Zhuoyu Li to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Zhuoyu&gt;&gt;Qianyue?<br />10:13:31 From Eric Schubert to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Yiran&gt;&gt;Eric<br />10:13:38 From Eric Schubert to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Eric&gt;&gt;Zoey<br />10:19:42 From Yue to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Sorry I have to quit zoom and rejoin - I think there&rsquo;s some issue with my speaker.<br />10:24:03 From Robert Kett to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Phatic communication<br />10:30:36 From Fanxuan Zhu to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; very good example!<br />10:30:39 From Guowei to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I really like a quote from the interview &ldquo;I think affection is a hard job and pets work really hard. These are complex relations of labor and play, love and violence, and to glorify them is illegitimate. But I also think that to be alive, to live and die with each other, is to be accountable for our forms of love and violence.&rdquo;<br />10:31:07 From Zhuoyu Li to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I also took that quote!<br />10:33:02 From Eric Schubert to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sympoeisis<br />10:33:07 From Robert Kett to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Also connects to Haraway&rsquo;s broader definition of kinship in that piece: &ldquo;By kin I mean those who have an enduring mutual, obligatory, non-optional, you-can&rsquo;t-just-cast-that-away-when-it-gets-inconvenient, enduring relatedness that carries consequences. I have a cousin, the cousin has me; I have a dog, a dog has me.&rdquo;<br />10:35:19 From Chen Shiyi to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The topic reminds me of this project by Dunne and Raby.<br />10:35:46 From Santanilla Mario to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; @Robert&hellip;After reading that I keep on thinking on my interactions like that &nbsp;I have Google, Google has me&hellip; I have MDP, MDP has me&hellip;<br />10:35:47 From Blake Kos to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Is that the example of the squid?<br />10:36:09 From Wang Zhiyan to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The relationship in the network is so diverse<br />10:41:44 From Alan Amaya to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I&rsquo;m with Haraway on not using Anthropocene anymore<br />10:44:00 From Alan Amaya to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I resisted the term Anthropocene because it centered the Anthropos &mdash; Man &mdash; as if the multiple crises and destructions that merit the term Anthropocene were a species act, as if we did it by virtue of being human, as opposed to being in situated historical processes rooted in systems of a world-changing operation four or five hundred years ago, with the invention of the slave-based plantation and the emergence of capitalism. The creation of wealth through these systems has brought us into our current situation. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a species act.<br />10:47:07 From Zoey to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard to answer that question. Human beings think they know what motivates a dog, but it&rsquo;s pure denial. It is a lie we tell ourselves. We are just learning how to pay attention to what a dog&rsquo;s ears are really doing and what their eyes are really attending to, what range of color their eyes see, and what their range of olfactory perception really is. Or the ways they use their bodies in response to really small cues, or the way they exchange messages. If you&rsquo;re going to play a sport well with a member of another species, you have to learn what actually motivates them. &ldquo;<br />10:48:58 From Robert Kett to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.jstor.org/stable/3178066<br />10:56:27 From Noah Curtis to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mutual benefit<br />10:56:40 From Blake Kos to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There is theory around plant using us to travel the world<br />10:57:59 From Alan Amaya to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The bee orchid story ðŸ˜­<br />10:58:07 From Zoey to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe just treat it as an exchange for the interests would be much easier<br />11:00:09 From Maxim Safiouline to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250296115/thenewbreed<br />11:00:36 From Maxim Safiouline to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ^ What Our History with Animals Reveals about Our Future with Robots<br />11:01:10 From Alan Amaya to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ^This perfect for my research thanks Maxim!<br />11:01:39 From Wang Zhiyan to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; And that&rsquo;s probably why Donna Haraway think making kin with more than human world is an urgent ethical responsibility<br />11:02:56 From Robert Kett to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.amazon.com/Art-Agency-Anthropological-Alfred-Gell/dp/0198280149<br />11:04:09 From Wang Zeyu to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; In movie Guy, the heroine falls in love with a NPC in game who is actually designed by a boy who loves the heroine in the real world,<br />11:08:33 From Wang Zhiyan to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe only as a media<br />11:09:57 From Maxim Safiouline to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691220550/the-mushroom-at-the-end-of-the-world<br />11:10:52 From Maxim Safiouline to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ^ On the Possibility of Life in Capitalist Ruins - about the possible networks of kinship centered around commodities and post-commodities<br />11:14:38 From Gao Yining to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; https://askabiologist.asu.edu/questions/are-viruses-alive#:~:text=Living%20things%20use%20energy.,do%20not%20consider%20them%20alive.<br />11:16:05 From Blake Kos to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Animism<br />11:18:35 From Robert Kett to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/685064<br />11:20:08 From Maxim Safiouline to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; https://aeon.co/essays/how-margaret-mead-became-a-hate-figure-for-conservatives<br />11:24:21 From Chen Shiyi to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-could-pull-instagram-facebook-europe-data-sharing-ruling-2022-2<br />11:26:37 From Wang Zhiyan to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; More choices rather than naturally given<br />11:27:40 From Blake Kos to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Only time will tell&hellip;"<br />11:27:51 From Ben Hooker to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.dukeupress.edu/kin<br />11:30:12 From Wang Zhiyan to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you Robert!<br />11:30:24 From Fanxuan Zhu to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you Robert<br />11:30:26 From Alan Amaya to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you!<br />11:30:34 From Yue to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; thanks!<br />11:30:35 From Gao Yining to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you!</p>
