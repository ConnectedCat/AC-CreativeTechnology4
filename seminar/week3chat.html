And I was quite turned away by the fact that the only tie between me and my account is several strings of super long numbers which I already lost<br />10:15:47 From &nbsp;Gao Yining &nbsp;to &nbsp;Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; My undergrad roommate was mining bitcoin at home and I noticed it through the electric bill.<br />10:16:04 From &nbsp;Maxim Safiouline &nbsp;to &nbsp;Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ðŸ˜³<br />10:16:22 From &nbsp;Alan Amaya &nbsp;to &nbsp;Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ðŸ˜¬<br />10:24:53 From &nbsp;Qianyue Yuwen &nbsp;to &nbsp;Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; In PoW, the voting power is proportional to the computational power of the node; while in PoS, the voting power of the system is proportional to the equity held.<br />10:25:36 From &nbsp;Alan Amaya &nbsp;to &nbsp;Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Can we talk about what mining is?
