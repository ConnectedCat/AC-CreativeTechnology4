            <h2>/*<br />Project 1: <br />Techno-kludging<br />*/</h2>
            <div class="project-brief">
                <p>Do you have a technology-dependent creative project in your head that you want to build? Do you look at a particular kind of work by other interactive designers/artists and think "I wish I knew how to make that!" In this project, we're dropping you in at the deep end. We want you to propose a creative technology project, and we're going to try to help you build it. Or, more accurately, we're going to help you identify and kludge together a small critical piece of it. The question of scope – figuring out what that "small critical piece" is – is fundamental here, and will underlie many of our discussions as your projects progress.</p>
                <p>To "kludge" is to use an ill-assorted collection of parts to make something. It typically has negative connotations, suggesting something that has been quickly and shoddily put together. But kludging can be a valuable part of an iterative, exploratory, creative design process as we move back and forth between thinking and making, concept and prototype. This is especially true when working with (and designing) interactive technologies, where we are concerned with dynamic experiences and behaviors.</p>
                <p><strong>Tips for a productive project</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't spend time trying to think of a completely novel idea before you start. In this project it's totally OK – we encourage it, even – to be motivated by the desire to replicate interactive and/or technological characteristics you have identified in others' work.</li>
                    <li>The project might turn out not the way you envisioned it.</li>
                    <li>Although we hope to learn some practical things, we are equally interested in the process of thinking through making.</li>
                    <li>Physical computing might be too much of a challenge in this short intro project, unless you already have components or can get them asap.</li>
                </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Upload diagrams and images of your building work / process.</li>

                    <li> - Choose a technological artifact – a consumer product, an interactive artwork, a piece of software, an installation, anything – which exhibits some characteristics of a 'creative tech' interest of yours. (Choose more than one if you are torn between multiple interests!) Find an image of your artifact and drop it in the Slack channel.</li>

What are some of the tools and resources used to create those parts and bring them together? Be prepared to share your thoughts when we next meet.</li>

                <h5>Homework:</h5>
                <p>Make a system diagram of your chosen artifact. (You can continue with what you already have, or choose something new.) Your diagram should communicate the types of connection and configuration of key components of your artifact. But (!) we want you to go above and beyond this strict engineering definition of a system diagram. As designers we are interestested in tangibility, materiality, experience, aesthetic, emotion, cultural context, social connections... What are other qualities you could foreground and integrate into the diagram?</p>
                <p>Consider: If you were to build one specific technological part of this artifact, what would that be? This question is an entirely subjective one, and refers to your own aspirations as a maker. We strongly encourage you not to get too caught up in conceptual interests at this point. Is there an interaction, behavior, or function you would like to emulate, or a technological effect you are yearning to achieve? What tools do you think you would use? What skills would you need?</p>
                <p>Prepare to come to the next class with the homework on 2-3 slides which we can add to a shared deck at the start of the meeting.</p>

            <h2>/*<br />Project 2:<br />Simulation & Design<br />*/</h2>
            <div class="project-brief">
                <p>Simulations are generated by models that mimic alternate conditions. Before the digital era, simulations were mostly associated with non-design fields, such as engineering, epidemiology, astronomy, meteorology, psychology, and economics. These models were typically used to predict or infer performance or events in possible, or future, or otherwise unknowable states.</p>
                <p>When software-enabled simulation eventually emerged, it evolved rapidly in non-research domains such as gaming and visual effects for cinema, with echoes in the art world from the very beginning. From there, crossovers continued into architecture and countless media applications. Today, sophisticated simulations are ubiquitous: in VR, AR, games, movies, GUIs (not to mention the simulations of disasters - like pandemics, fires, and hurricanes - we consume daily through the media.)</p>
                <p>AR, VR, gaming, and animation all employ tools that could be classified as simulations of one type or another, and in this workshop will be experimenting with these fundamentals using a game engine to apply behaviors and conditions into a digital environment.</p>
                <p>Alongside this technical exposure, however, we will consider - in our projects and conversation - the influence of tools for simulation on design and art. Unlike simulation, representation has long been the realm of the designer: illustrating the world for the purposes of communication or as a form of instrumentalized image-making for developing texts, media, objects, and places to be produced.</p>
                <p>Is this significant? Is it merely a distinction without a difference?</p>
                <p><strong>How can the designer/artist use simulation critically, productively, originally?</strong> How does one shift their attention from questions of form to questions of behavior and performance (or are they the same thing)? When using tools developed for specific industries (namely, gaming and visual effects) does one intervene to default qualities of the expected use? Does the capability of creating digital models capable of self-generating and simulating outcomes alter one's perceptions as a maker in general?</p>
                <p>*</p>
                <p>Climatological, social, and technological changes are occurring increasingly at a global, rather than regional, scale. While addressing issues of this complexity has always required the collaboration of multiple forms of scientific expertise, inexpensive super-computation and accessible software allows designers to engage with topics long considered strictly the purview of these scientific researchers and engineers.</p>
                <p><strong>For this project, you will create a vivarium: a micro-world where a defined set of properties and behaviors are placed and developed.</strong> As a starting point, you will be assigned one of the following verbs, each inspired by a current global crisis, nearing a tipping point: a condition where a controlling system is overwhelmed, sometimes beyond potential return or repair.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1. In this world-building exercise, choices about visual representation are as important as simulated behavior. <strong>Make sure you have sufficiently developed the visual language of your project to move it far away from Unity’s default look and feel.</strong> (Unless, of course, your use of the default is intentional.) Consider: what elements in your world are figurative, what’s literal? What are you referencing through these choices? There is also a strategic, practical reason for doing this; if your project looks default people likely won’t be interested in it.</li>
                    <li>2. Use screen recordings of your running simulation as 'raw footage'. Create an edited sequence of short video clips/GIFs (as well as images) to document various features, moments, events. How do you tell a story about your world through this clip sequence? What details do you crop in on? How do you use captions in combination with your collection of clips? <strong>Consider this documentation requirement a fundamental part of the design brief.</strong></li>

            <div class="project-brief">
                <p>Communication lies at the core of all media. From speech to the written word, from radio to social networks - the core function of media has been to enable and facilitate communication. In this project we're going to take on this radical approach to communication, and try to get to the root of mediated exchange. We will examine how data is collected, how it is transformed into information, how it can be encoded, transmitted, and decoded. In the process we will encounter the need to build contextualized systems of meaning: systems of representation that maintain internal coherence, but might not make a lot of sense when seen from the outside.</p>
                <p>Working with a partner you will construct two electronic beings capable of percieving some aspects of the environment around them. Use whatever sensors are necessary to create their "worldview." Then you will need to connect them into a network that would enable them to communicate their findings, and respond to the communications of their counterpart.</p>
                <p><strong>Things to consider in this project:</strong> Are both creatures going to be in the same environment or in different ones? Will their "worldviews" (the sensory data they receive) be the same, opposite, or unrelated? Will they be stationary or mobile - and if mobile: self-propelled, or moving with the help of another being. How will their sensory perceptions be processed internally - and is there difference in the way one processes data from the other? How will the result of this process be encoded for transmission? Will the transmission be continuous or intermittent? Will they be able to transmit and receive information at the same time or will they take turns? Is their communication going to be preceptible by the outsiders?</p>

                <p>If you already have experience making drawings with computers, you know that in that process you draw a circle, then a rectangle, a line, some triangles until you compose the image you want. That process is very similar to writing a letter or a book by hand - it is a set of instructions that do one task after another.</p>
                <p>Shaders are also a set of instructions, but the instructions are executed all at once for every single pixel on the screen. That means the code you write has to behave differently depending on the position of the pixel on the screen. Like a type press, your program will work as a function that receives a position and returns a color, and when it's compiled it will run extraordinarily fast.</p>

                <h5>In-class:</h5>
                <p>Workshop: Introduction to fragment shaders. Tools and methods for programing shaders.</p>

                <h5>Homework:</h5>
                <p>Create an object in Unity or any other environment of your choosing and color it using shaders in a way that “makes sense.“ Makes sense” can be interpreted broadly. Some options:
                <ul>
                    <li>Make a lava lamp where the inside blobs are driven by a shader.</li>
                    <li>Make some bubbling soup or a cauldron.</li>
                    <li>Make washing machine where the window part is a shader.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Think about something that can't be created easily without a shader. Think about a shader's strengths and weaknesses. This homework is most of all meant to be a prompt to encourage exploration, which is why its left to broad interpretation.</p>
