            <h2>/*<br />Project 1: <br />The Web as a Rube Goldberg Machine<br />*/</h2>
            <div class="project-brief">
                <p>The Web was built around the concept of requests and responses - a constant back and forth between a server on the Internet and a browser on your computer. As it grew and expanded the need arose to get exchange going not just between a person and a machine but among many machines.</p>
                <p>A user initiates a single action - a click of a button, a text entry, a page scroll - and the browser triggers a chain of events, most of them hidden behind the veil of the Cloud, to pass around some data from one server to another, like a ball in a pinball machine. The data can be used to request other data, to trigger different responses from servers, to capture more data. It can be formatted, rearranged, displayed in different contexts, - juxtaposed with other data.</p>
                <p>In the spirit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rube Goldberg’s fascination</a> with the mechanism over the end result - how can we build similar systems in the digital realm? What kind of data could be passed around? With services could be chained together to produce some unexpected outcomes? What would the triggers look like - and the end results? None of those need to be practical, efficient or even reasonable - the focus is on the celebration of the chains of events and the mechanisms that enable them.</p>

            <h2>/*<br />Project 2:<br />Simulation & Design<br />*/</h2>
            <div class="project-brief">
                <p>Simulations are generated by models that mimic alternate conditions. Before the digital era, simulations were mostly associated with non-design fields, such as engineering, epidemiology, astronomy, meteorology, psychology, and economics. These models were typically used to predict or infer performance or events in possible, or future, or otherwise unknowable states.</p>
                <p>When software-enabled simulation eventually emerged, it evolved rapidly in non-research domains such as gaming and visual effects for cinema, with echoes in the art world from the very beginning. From there, crossovers continued into architecture and countless media applications. Today, sophisticated simulations are ubiquitous: in VR, AR, games, movies, GUIs (not to mention the simulations of disasters - like pandemics, fires, and hurricanes - we consume daily through the media.)</p>
                <p>AR, VR, gaming, and animation all employ tools that could be classified as simulations of one type or another, and in this workshop will be experimenting with these fundamentals using a game engine to apply behaviors and conditions into a digital environment.</p>
                <p>Alongside this technical exposure, however, we will consider - in our projects and conversation - the influence of tools for simulation on design and art. Unlike simulation, representation has long been the realm of the designer: illustrating the world for the purposes of communication or as a form of instrumentalized image-making for developing texts, media, objects, and places to be produced.</p>
                <p>Is this significant? Is it merely a distinction without a difference?</p>
                <p><strong>How can the designer/artist use simulation critically, productively, originally?</strong> How does one shift their attention from questions of form to questions of behavior and performance (or are they the same thing)? When using tools developed for specific industries (namely, gaming and visual effects) does one intervene to default qualities of the expected use? Does the capability of creating digital models capable of self-generating and simulating outcomes alter one's perceptions as a maker in general?</p>
                <p>*</p>
                <p>Climatological, social, and technological changes are occurring increasingly at a global, rather than regional, scale. While addressing issues of this complexity has always required the collaboration of multiple forms of scientific expertise, inexpensive super-computation and accessible software allows designers to engage with topics long considered strictly the purview of these scientific researchers and engineers.</p>
                <p><strong>For this project, you will create a vivarium: a micro-world where a defined set of properties and behaviors are placed and developed.</strong> As a starting point, you will be assigned one of the following verbs, each inspired by a current global crisis, nearing a tipping point: a condition where a controlling system is overwhelmed, sometimes beyond potential return or repair.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1. In this world-building exercise, choices about visual representation are as important as simulated behavior. <strong>Make sure you have sufficiently developed the visual language of your project to move it far away from Unity’s default look and feel.</strong> (Unless, of course, your use of the default is intentional.) Consider: what elements in your world are figurative, what’s literal? What are you referencing through these choices? There is also a strategic, practical reason for doing this; if your project looks default people likely won’t be interested in it.</li>
                    <li>2. Use screen recordings of your running simulation as 'raw footage'. Create an edited sequence of short video clips/GIFs (as well as images) to document various features, moments, events. How do you tell a story about your world through this clip sequence? What details do you crop in on? How do you use captions in combination with your collection of clips? <strong>Consider this documentation requirement a fundamental part of the design brief.</strong></li>

            <div class="project-brief">
                <p>Communication lies at the core of all media. From speech to the written word, from radio to social networks - the core function of media has been to enable and facilitate communication. In this project we're going to take on this radical approach to communication, and try to get to the root of mediated exchange. We will examine how data is collected, how it is transformed into information, how it can be encoded, transmitted, and decoded. In the process we will encounter the need to build contextualized systems of meaning: systems of representation that maintain internal coherence, but might not make a lot of sense when seen from the outside.</p>
                <p>Working with a partner you will construct two electronic beings capable of percieving some aspects of the environment around them. Use whatever sensors are necessary to create their "worldview." Then you will need to connect them into a network that would enable them to communicate their findings, and respond to the communications of their counterpart.</p>
                <p><strong>Things to consider in this project:</strong> Are both creatures going to be in the same environment or in different ones? Will their "worldviews" (the sensory data they receive) be the same, opposite, or unrelated? Will they be stationary or mobile - and if mobile: self-propelled, or moving with the help of another being. How will their sensory perceptions be processed internally - and is there difference in the way one processes data from the other? How will the result of this process be encoded for transmission? Will the transmission be continuous or intermittent? Will they be able to transmit and receive information at the same time or will they take turns? Is their communication going to be preceptible by the outsiders?</p>

                <p>If you already have experience making drawings with computers, you know that in that process you draw a circle, then a rectangle, a line, some triangles until you compose the image you want. That process is very similar to writing a letter or a book by hand - it is a set of instructions that do one task after another.</p>
                <p>Shaders are also a set of instructions, but the instructions are executed all at once for every single pixel on the screen. That means the code you write has to behave differently depending on the position of the pixel on the screen. Like a type press, your program will work as a function that receives a position and returns a color, and when it's compiled it will run extraordinarily fast.</p>

                <h5>In-class:</h5>
                <p>Workshop: Introduction to fragment shaders. Tools and methods for programing shaders.</p>

                <h5>Homework:</h5>
                <p>Create an object in Unity or any other environment of your choosing and color it using shaders in a way that “makes sense.“ Makes sense” can be interpreted broadly. Some options:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make a lava lamp where the inside blobs are driven by a shader.</li>
                        <li>Make some bubbling soup or a cauldron.</li>
                        <li>Make washing machine where the window part is a shader.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Think about something that can't be created easily without a shader. Think about a shader's strengths and weaknesses. This homework is most of all meant to be a prompt to encourage exploration, which is why its left to broad interpretation.</p>
